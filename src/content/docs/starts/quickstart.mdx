<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  Binaries built from go source code shows **Virus False Positive** somehow on [Windows](https://go.dev/doc/faq#virus). VMR is signed by osslsigncode to avoid this annoying situation. However, we cannot ensure that it will never happen. In case of False Positive, you can manually add the VMR directory to your Trusted directory, or try to install the [certificate](https://github.com/gvcgo/version-manager/blob/main/scripts/vmr.pfx).

## Can I customize the Installation Dir for SDKs?

Yes, of course. A hint will prompt to ask for customizing your SDK Installation Dir during the installation of VMR for the first time on your system.

```
