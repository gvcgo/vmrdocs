## Set Proxy

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  Proxy is highly recommended if github.com responds slowly.
</Aside>

```bash
vmr sp "http(socks5)://127.0.0.1:xxxx"
```

## Set Reverse Proxy

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  Choose **either** reverse proxy **or** proxy.
</Aside>

```bash
vmr sr "https://proxy.vmr.us.kg/proxy/"
```

vmr -h
```

```bash
vmr show
```

## Show available version list for an SDK.

```bash
vmr search <sdk-name>
```

## Show local installed versions for an SDK.

```bash
vmr local <sdk-name>
```

## Install and switch to the specific version of an SDK globally.

```bash
vmr use <sdk-name@version>
```

## Temporarily switch to specific version of an SDK in current termianl session.

```bash
vmr use -s <sdk-name@version>
```

## Lock the SDK version for current project.

```bash
vmr use -l <sdk-name@version>
```

## Uninstall the specific version of an SDK. (But not the one currently in use.)

```bash
vmr uninstall <sdk-name@version>
```

## Uninstall all local installed versions for an SDK. (Including the one currently in use.)

```bash
vmr uninstall <sdk-name@all>
```

## SDK List not found?

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  If VMR shows **No SDK Found**, you probably need to set a [proxy](/guides/tutorial/#set-proxy) for VMR.
</Aside>

## How to enable multi-thread download?

Set number of threads > 1.
```bash
vmr st 2
```

## How to toggle customed mirrors?
