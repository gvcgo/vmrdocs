## Set Proxy

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  Proxy is highly recommended if github.com responds slowly.
</Aside>

```bash
vmr sp "http(socks5)://127.0.0.1:xxxx"
```

## Set Reverse Proxy

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  Choose **either** reverse proxy **or** proxy.
</Aside>

```bash
vmr sr "https://proxy.vmr.us.kg/proxy/"
```

## Show help info.

```bash
vmr -h
```

## Show available SDK list.

```bash
vmr show
```

## Show available version list for an SDK.

```bash
vmr search <sdk-name>
```

## Show local installed SDKs.

```bash
vmr installed-sdks 
```

## Show local installed SDKs and their versions.

```bash
vmr installed-info 
```

## Show local installed versions for an SDK.

```bash
vmr local <sdk-name>
```

## Install and switch to the specific version of an SDK globally.

```bash
vmr use <sdk-name@version>
```

## Temporarily switch to specific version of an SDK in current termianl session.

```bash
vmr use -s <sdk-name@version>
```

## Lock the SDK version for current project.

```bash
vmr use -l <sdk-name@version>
```

## Uninstall the specific version of an SDK. (But not the one currently in use.)

```bash
vmr uninstall <sdk-name@version>
```

## Uninstall all local installed versions for an SDK. (Including the one currently in use.)

```bash
vmr uninstall <sdk-name@all>
```

## Add auto-completions for shell.

```bash
vmr add-completions 
```

## Allow/Disallow nested sessions.

```bash
vmr nested-sessions
```
<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  You should never use nested sessions and lock file at the same time. Or vmr will start a new session every time you run the cd command.
</Aside>

##  Show the mode of crrent shell.

```bash
vmr is-session-mode
```
<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  Note that session mode is not recommended for common use. So you should close the terminal or use exit command to terminate session mode.
  If you have installed an SDK in a session-mode shell using global mode, then the source command will not work. 
  You can then use the customed alias svmr to flush envs.
</Aside>

## SDK List not found?

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  If VMR shows **No SDK Found**, you probably need to set a [proxy](/guides/tutorial/#set-proxy) for VMR.
</Aside>

## How to enable multi-thread download?

Set number of threads > 1.
```bash
vmr st 2
```

## How to toggle customed mirrors?

```bash
# $HOME/.vmr/customed_mirrors.toml
vmr tm
```
The default customed mirrors is available [here](https://github.com/gvcgo/vsources/blob/main/mirrors/customed_mirrors.toml).
