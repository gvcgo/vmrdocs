<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  When an SDK is not supported by VMR, but available in [Conda-Forge](https://conda-forge.org/packages/),
  You can install the SDK using commands below. But you need to add Envs manually according to the hints from VMR.
</Aside>

## Search versions through Conda

```bash
vmr search -c sdk-name
```

## Install a version through Conda

```bash
vmr use -c sdk-name@version
```

## Where are the envs restored for MacOS/Linux?
