!> If you are using **VMR** on Windows11, you need to enable the **Developer Mode** as **VMR** requires to create symbolic links. If you're on Windows10, and any creating-symbolic-links-failure occurrs, you can try **VMR** with **Admin Privilege**.

!> Binaries built from go source code shows Virus Positive somehow on Windows. It's Totally False Positive. For details, Please see [here](https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/my-compiled-exe-file-is-declared-as-a-virus/34038). When this happens, you need to manually add $HOME, $HOME\.vm, and the SDK-Installation-Dir you have specified, to the Trusted List.

!> **VMR** customized command **source** for refreshing **Path** env in current powershell.

### Where is VMR installed?

```bash
$HOME/.vm
```

### Can I customize the installation Dir for SDKs?

Of course. When you are installing VMR for the first time, **"Enter the SDK installation directory for vmr"** will prompt, you can just enter the path you want. If you've just input a wrong path, you can manually modify it in $HOME/.vm/config.json.
